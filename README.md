DocuMind AI – Intelligent Document Processing System

Python | OCR | FastAPI | Streamlit
November 2025

DocuMind AI is a production-grade document intelligence system designed to automate document understanding workflows using OCR and a modular, multi-agent architecture. The system focuses on accuracy, scalability, explainability, and operational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world enterprise use cases.

Project Highlights

Built a production-ready document processing pipeline for automated classification and information extraction, capable of processing 1,000+ documents per hour with 95% accuracy, reducing manual document review effort by 40+ hours per week.

Engineered scalable data preprocessing and feature extraction pipelines supporting 5 document types (invoices, contracts, forms, receipts, and reports), improving classification performance with F1-score gains from 0.73 to 0.95.

Developed and deployed an interactive Streamlit dashboard with real-time analytics and decision visibility, enabling stakeholders to monitor system performance, identify bottlenecks, and validate outputs—resulting in 30% faster document approval workflows.

Conducted iterative model experimentation using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, systematically analyzing performance trade-offs to inform deployment decisions and establish robust monitoring and evaluation protocols.
